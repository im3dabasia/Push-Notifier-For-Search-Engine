# Push Notifier
## Eshaan Dabasiya
### Have a look at demo(!https://im3dabasia.github.io/Push-Notifier-For-Search-Engine/)

I have developed a simple program which will basically send notifications in google chrome.

1) In the first part the notification is sent after the user clicks a specific button ```Click Me```
2) In the second scenario the notification will be sent to the user if they leave my page. I will be notifiying them to come back to my page every 1 second. Till they dont come back I will keep on sending the notifications.
